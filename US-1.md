As a customer, I want to start a reservation by providing a location (postal code, city, or airport) and selecting pickup and return dates. Additionally, I want to be shown vehicles that match specific criteria, including type (CARs, SUVs, Vans, Trucks), category (compact, standard, intermediate, etc.), and price range. Furthermore, I should be able to add extra equipment to my reservation at an additional cost.
